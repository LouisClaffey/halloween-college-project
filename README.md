This is my submission for a web-design halloween project, Using HTML5 and CSS. A students design choices were dictated by an example image.
Go to 'Example_Image' in images folder, to see what the design of the homepage was supposed to look like.
All page structures and colour palettes for every page in the project were to be based off of this design, however students had some creative freedom in the pages content.

I recieved 92.5% for my efforts.
